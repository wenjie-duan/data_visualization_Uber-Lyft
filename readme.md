## Big idea:
By analyzing the real-time price collected by Uber/Lyft API queries in Boston in Nov-Dec 2018 , we found that it’s better to choose Lyft when you are not looking for a Luxury car and when there is no Surge_Multiplier imposed.

## 3‐minute story: 
Uber or Lyft, which is cheaper? Lyft seems to be the cheaper one, but is that always the case? Since we are students who want to save money in our pocket, this question is worth a thought. Our group is trying to figure out the price of these ride-sharing apps and compare their price in certain circumstance, to guide our selection. With no public price data shared by Lyft/Uber itself, we found a dataset in Kaggle. This dataset shows real-time data collected by Uber/Lyft API queries in Boston in Nov-Dec 2018. 
We analyzed this dataset with exploratory analysis, and our goal was to find out the cheaper cab solution in different conditions. We found that, in general cases, Lyft is indeed cheaper than Uber in Shared, normal and XL line. Especially, Lyft Shared is much cheaper than Uber Pool. However, Lyft’s luxury line (Lux) is more expensive than Uber’s luxury line (Black). Moreover, Lyft is more sensitive to busy traffic, because surge_multipliers occur more often in Lyft. The multiplier would largely increase price to 1.4 times in average. To wrap up, when you are looking for a Luxury car, go for Uber. When you see a surge multiplier in Lyft, go for Uber. Otherwise, go for Lyft.
